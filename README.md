- Accepts a paragraph of text as the input text (to be summarized) using Streamlit's `st.text_input()`
- Text is split into chunks via `CharacterTextSplitter()` along with its `split_text()` method
- Document is generated via `Document()
- Text summarization is achieved using `load_summarize_chain()` by applying the `run()` method on the input `docs`.
